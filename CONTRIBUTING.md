## Design Guide for RemindiCare

### Adding a new feature or change

Before starting work on a new feature, itâ€™s crucial to ensure that your main branch is up to date. This prevents conflicts and ensures you're working with the latest version of the code.

#### Steps:

1. **Checkout to Main Branch:**
   ```bash
   $ git checkout main
   ```

2. **Pull the Latest Changes from Upstream:**
   ```bash
   $ git pull -r origin main
   ```

3. **Create a New Branch:**
   ```bash
   $ git checkout -b <topic-branch-name>
   ```

4. **Linking the Pull Request to an Issue:**
   When you open a pull request, link it to the relevant issue by including a reference in the pull request description:
   ```
   Fixes #<issue-number>
   ```
   This will automatically close the issue when the pull request is merged.

5. **Push Your Branch:**
   ```bash
   $ git push --set-upstream origin <topic-branch-name>
   ```

6. **Open a Pull Request:**
   Follow [this guide](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request/#creating-the-pull-request) to open a pull request with a clear title and description. Make sure to link to the relevant issue as mentioned above.

**Tips:**
- For significant tasks, open a Pull Request early with a `[WIP]` (Work In Progress) prefix to get feedback and assistance from the community.
- Allow maintainers to make changes to your Pull Request branch by following [these instructions](https://help.github.com/articles/allowing-changes-to-a-pull-request-branch-created-from-a-fork).


### When Collaborating: Multiple Contributors on the Same Branch

When multiple contributors are working on the same branch, coordination is key to avoid conflicts and ensure smooth integration of changes.

#### Steps:

1. **Regularly Pull Changes:**
   Regularly pull changes from the shared branch to keep your local repository up to date:
   ```bash
   $ git pull origin <shared-branch>
   ```

2. **Communicate with Team Members:**
   Use comments on the pull request, issues, or other communication tools to coordinate with team members. This helps prevent duplicate work and conflicts.

3. **Resolve Conflicts:**
   If conflicts arise when pulling changes, resolve them promptly. Communicate with your team to decide the best approach for conflict resolution.

4. **Test Thoroughly:**
   Before pushing changes to a shared branch, thoroughly test your code to ensure it integrates well with existing code. This helps maintain the stability of the branch.

5. **Push Changes to the Shared Branch:**
   Once your changes are ready and tested, push them to the shared branch:
   ```bash
   $ git push origin <shared-branch>
   ```

6. **Review and Merge Pull Requests:**
   Collaborate on reviewing pull requests. Provide constructive feedback and approve changes when they are ready to be merged.

  
### Submitting a Pull Request

Good pull requests, whether patches, improvements, or new features, are a fantastic help. They should remain focused in scope and avoid containing unrelated commits.

If you have never created a pull request before, welcome ðŸŽ‰ ðŸ˜„. [Here is a great tutorial](https://opensource.guide/how-to-contribute/#opening-a-pull-request) on how to send one :)

#### Summary of Steps:

1. **Get the Latest Changes from Upstream:**
   ```bash
   $ git checkout main
   $ git pull -r origin main
   ```

2. **Create a New Topic Branch:**
   ```bash
   $ git checkout -b <topic-branch-name>
   ```

3. **Make Your Code Changes:** Follow the [Coding rules](#coding-rules).

4. **Push Your Topic Branch:**
   ```bash
   $ git push --set-upstream origin <topic-branch-name>
   ```

5. **Open a Pull Request:**
   Follow [this guide](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request/#creating-the-pull-request) with a clear title and description.

6. **Things to add

By following these guidelines, youâ€™ll ensure a smooth and collaborative development process. Happy coding!
